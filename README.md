### Future Plan (On Hold)

We are currently in the process of rewriting the code and replacing Flask with Django. Our goal is to create a more organized and secure system with an authentication system that uses a token link to verify accounts. The new version will have all first-class website features.

### End Goal

Our ultimate aim is to build a platform that serves as the "Facebook of the MUN world," offering a wide range of features for Model UN enthusiasts.
